## The example of the Microsoft Visual Studio solution provides an example of using Aspose.Slides for C++ in Python.

The solution contains two projects:
- **AsposeSlidesCppExtension** project is a C++ extension for Python using Aspose.Slides for C++.

- **PythonApplication** project is a Python script that uses AsposeSlidesCppExtension module. The project is configured for Python 3.6. If you have a different version of Python, you can select it in "Python Environments". The example supports Python 3.0 and above.

Note:
1. To build the example you should activate Python of the appropriate bitness in "Python Environments".

2. If you want to debug C++ extension you should install the debug binaries. For this, on the "Advanced Options" page of Python installer, check the box "Download debugging symbols".
